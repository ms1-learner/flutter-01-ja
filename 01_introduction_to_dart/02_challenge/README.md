# Challenge 2

In this challenge, you'll create a Dart program that analyzes and processes two given paragraphs and prints some statistics related to them.

Your tasks are as follows:

- Save the length of each paragraph in a variable.
- Save the lowercase variant of each paragraph in a variable.
- Save a substring of your choice from each paragraph in a variable.
- Replace all wrong words that are enclosed within square brackets in each paragraph `[]` with words of your choice.
- Compare the lengths of both paragraphs and print something like "Paragraph 1 is longer as it has `X` characters more than paragraph 2" where `X` is the difference in length.
- Print a message that reads "The length of paragraph 1 is: `X`" where `X` is the length of the paragraph. Do the same for paragraph 2.
- Print the lowercase variant of both paragraphs after you've replaced all the wrong words within each.
- Print the average number of characters in both paragraphs. Make sure to truncate any decimals.
