# Challenge 1

In this challenge, you're given a Dart file `convert.dart` with two pre-defined variables, `walkman` and `toothpaste`. A pre-defined function, `convert`, takes a list of maps as a parameter and returns a list of lists.

The main task here is to update the `convert` function to return a list that contains inner lists. Each internal list should include the values associated with each map.

An example of the expected functionality:

```dart
convert([map1, map2]); // [[all values of map1], [all values of map2]]
```
